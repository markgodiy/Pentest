# Week 4: Discuss Your Scan Results (Required/Graded) 

During Week 4, you will collaborate with your team members and discuss the results of your findings from your scans on the network.
Discuss the following this week:

Discuss which tool or technique was most effective for you on the scanning engagement (Zenmap/Nmap, OpenVAS, or Raw Socket Connection).

- Provide at least one screenshot that displays the IP address and port of the target system.  
- Discuss the three vulnerabilities that you think are the largest concern for your client.  
- Discuss what you think is the best way for the client to address these security issues. Examples include a full penetration test and/or hiring additional IT security staff.
- 
Be respectful, provide others with positive encouragement, and congratulate your teammates after they have successfully completed the network scan.
