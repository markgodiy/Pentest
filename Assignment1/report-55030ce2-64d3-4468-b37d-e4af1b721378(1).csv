  in OpenSSL, when using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
  (ECDSA) for the ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suite, did not properly implement
  curves over binary fields. This could allow an attacker to determine
  private keys via a timing attack. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04
  LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-1945)

  Adam Langley discovered that the ephemeral Elliptic Curve
  Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) functionality in OpenSSL did not ensure thread
  safety while processing handshake messages from clients. This
  could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via
  out-of-order messages that violate the TLS protocol. This issue only
  affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu
  11.04. (CVE-2011-3210)

  Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson discovered that the Datagram
  Transport Layer Security (DTLS) implementation in OpenSSL performed a
  MAC check only if certain padding is valid. This could allow a remote
  attacker to recover plaintext. (CVE-2011-4108)

  Antonio Martin discovered that a flaw existed in the fix to address
  CVE-2011-4108, the DTLS MAC check failure. This could allow a remote
  attacker to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-0050)

  Ben Laurie discovered a double free vulnerability in OpenSSL that could
  be triggered when the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag is enabled. This
  could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. This
  issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10
  and Ubuntu 11.04. (CVE-2011-4109)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL, in certain circumstances involving
  ECDH or ECDHE cipher suites, used an incorrect modular reduction
  algorithm in its implementation of the P-256 and P-384 NIST elliptic
  curves. This could allow a remote attacker to obtain the private
  key of a TLS server via multiple handshake attempts. This issue only
  affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. (CVE-2011-4354)

  Adam Langley discovered that the SSL 3.0 implementation in OpenSSL
  did not properly initialize data structures for block cipher
  padding. This could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive
  information. (CVE-2011-4576)

  Andrew Chi discovered that OpenSSL, when RFC 3779 support is enabled,
  could trigger an assert when handling an X.509 certificate containing
  certificate-extension data associated with IP address blocks or
  Autonomous System (AS) identifiers. This could allow a remote attacker
  to cause a denial of servi ...

  CVE-2012-0831 introduced a regression where the state of the
  magic_quotes_gpc setting was not correctly reflected when calling
  the ini_get() function.

  We apologize for the inconvenience.

  Original advisory details:

  It was discovered that PHP computed hash values for form parameters
  without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably.
  This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by
  sending many crafted parameters. (CVE-2011-4885)

  ATTENTION: this update changes previous PHP behavior by
  limiting the number of external input variables to 1000.
  This may be increased by adding a 'max_input_vars'
  directive to the php.ini configuration file. See
  the references for more information.

  Stefan Esser discovered that the fix to address the predictable hash
  collision issue, CVE-2011-4885, did not properly handle the situation
  where the limit was reached. This could allow a remote attacker to
  cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via a request
  containing a large number of variables. (CVE-2012-0830)

  It was discovered that PHP did not always check the return value of
  the zend_strndup function. This could allow a remote attacker to
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4153)

  It was discovered that PHP did not properly enforce libxslt security
  settings. This could allow a remote attacker to create arbitrary
  files via a crafted XSLT stylesheet that uses the libxslt output
  extension. (CVE-2012-0057)

  It was discovered that PHP did not properly enforce that PDORow
  objects could not be serialized and not be saved in a session. A
  remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service via an
  application crash. (CVE-2012-0788)

  It was discovered that PHP allowed the magic_quotes_gpc setting to
  be disabled remotely. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass
  restrictions that could prevent an SQL injection. (CVE-2012-0831)

  USN 1126-1 addressed an issue where the /etc/cron.d/php5 cron job
  for PHP allowed local users to delete arbitrary files via a symlink
  attack on a directory under /var/lib/php5/. Emese Revfy discovered
  that the fix had not been applied to PHP for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. This
  update corrects the issue. We apologize for the error. (CVE-2011-0441)","

  without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably.
  This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by
  sending many crafted parameters. (CVE-2011-4885)

  ATTENTION: this update changes previous PHP behavior by
  limiting the number of external input variables to 1000.
  This may be increased by adding a 'max_input_vars'
  directive to the php.ini configuration file. See
  the references for more information.

  Stefan Esser discovered that the fix to address the predictable hash
  collision issue, CVE-2011-4885, did not properly handle the situation
  where the limit was reached. This could allow a remote attacker to
  cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via a request
  containing a large number of variables. (CVE-2012-0830)

  It was discovered that PHP did not always check the return value of
  the zend_strndup function. This could allow a remote attacker to
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4153)

  It was discovered that PHP did not properly enforce libxslt security
  settings. This could allow a remote attacker to create arbitrary
  files via a crafted XSLT stylesheet that uses the libxslt output
  extension. (CVE-2012-0057)

  It was discovered that PHP did not properly enforce that PDORow
  objects could not be serialized and not be saved in a session. A
  remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service via an
  application crash. (CVE-2012-0788)

  It was discovered that PHP allowed the magic_quotes_gpc setting to
  be disabled remotely. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass
  restrictions that could prevent an SQL injection. (CVE-2012-0831)

  USN 1126-1 addressed an issue where the /etc/cron.d/php5 cron job
  for PHP allowed local users to delete arbitrary files via a symlink
  attack on a directory under /var/lib/php5/. Emese Revfy discovered

  Ubuntu 6.06 LTS","USN 1126-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in PHP. The fix for
  CVE-2010-4697 introduced an incorrect reference counting regression
  in the Zend engine that caused the PHP interpreter to segfault. This
  regression affects Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

  The fixes for CVE-2011-1072 and CVE-2011-1144 introduced a regression
  in the PEAR installer that prevented it from creating its cache
  directory and reporting errors correctly.

  We apologize for the inconvenience.

  Original advisory details:

  Stephane Chazelas discovered that the /etc/cron.d/php5 cron job for
  PHP 5.3.5 allows local users to delete arbitrary files via a symlink
  attack on a directory under /var/lib/php5/. (CVE-2011-0441)

  Raphael Geisert and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the PEAR installer
  allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on
  the package.xml file, related to the (1) download_dir, (2) cache_dir,
  (3) tmp_dir, and (4) pear-build-download directories. (CVE-2011-1072,
  CVE-2011-1144)

  Ben Schmidt discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability in the PHP
  Zend engine could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (heap
  memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-4697)

  Martin Barbella discovered a buffer overflow in the PHP GD extension
  that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (application crash)
  via a large number of anti- aliasing steps in an argument to the
  imagepstext function. (CVE-2010-4698)

  It was discovered that PHP accepts the \0 character in a pathname,
  which might allow an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions
  by placing a safe file extension after this character. This issue
  is addressed in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu 11.04.
  (CVE-2006-7243)

  Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the grapheme_extract function
  in the PHP Internationalization extension (Intl) for ICU allow
  an attacker to cause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid
  size argument, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference. This
  issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu
  11.04. (CVE-2011-0420)

  Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the _zip_name_locate
  function in the PHP Zip extension does not properly handle a
  ZIPARCHIVE::FL_UNCHANGED argument, which might allow an attacker to
  cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via an empty
  ZIP archive. This issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu
  10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10, and Ubuntu 11.04. ( ...

  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
