3. **Explain the Importance of a Service-Level Agreement (SLA) and an Authorization to Test (ATT):**
   - Understand the purpose and contents of a Service-Level Agreement (SLA).
   - Understand the purpose and contents of an Authorization to Test (ATT).
   - Know how SLAs and ATTs help define the scope, responsibilities, and objectives of a penetration test.

4. **Given a Scenario, Create a Scope Document:**
   - Develop a comprehensive scope document for a penetration testing engagement.
   - Define the boundaries, objectives, and limitations of the test.

5. **Given a Scenario, Create a Rules of Engagement (RoE) Document:**
   - Develop a Rules of Engagement (RoE) document outlining the rules, constraints, and expectations for the penetration test.
   - Ensure that the RoE aligns with the scope and objectives of the engagement.

6. **Explain the Importance of Legal and Compliance Requirements:**
