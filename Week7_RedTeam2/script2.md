## database msf framework

As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the Metasploit Framework (msfconsole) provides several PostgreSQL database-related commands for managing the database that stores information about your penetration testing and exploitation activities. These commands can be used to interact with the database backend of Metasploit. Please note that the available commands may change with updates to Metasploit, so it's always a good idea to check the official documentation or use the `help` command in msfconsole for the most up-to-date information. Here are some common PostgreSQL database commands available in msfconsole:

1. `db_status`: This command checks the status of the database connection.

2. `db_connect`: You can use this command to connect to a PostgreSQL database. You'll need to provide the database type, username, password, host, and database name as arguments.

3. `db_disconnect`: This command is used to disconnect from the connected database.

4. `db_export`: It allows you to export data from the Metasploit database to various formats, such as CSV, XML, or JSON.

5. `db_import`: You can use this command to import data into the Metasploit database from an external file in various formats.

6. `hosts`: This command provides information about hosts that have been discovered and stored in the database. You can use it to view and filter host information.

7. `services`: This command displays information about services running on discovered hosts.

8. `vulns`: Use this command to view information about vulnerabilities that have been identified during your penetration tests.

9. `creds`: It shows stored credentials in the database, which can be useful for post-exploitation activities.

10. `loot`: This command allows you to access and manage loot obtained during penetration tests, such as captured files or sensitive data.

11. `workspace`: You can create, switch, or manage workspaces using this command. Workspaces are used to organize your data within the Metasploit database.

12. `workspace -h`: This command provides help on using workspaces and their related commands.

13. `note`: Use this command to add notes to hosts, services, vulnerabilities, or other database objects for documentation purposes.

14. `search`: You can search the database for specific hosts, services, or vulnerabilities using this command.

15. `services -p`: This command allows you to filter services based on port numbers.

16. `vulns -t`: You can filter vulnerabilities based on their type using this command.

17. `hosts -c`: This command is used to filter hosts by criteria such as operating system or services.

18. `creds -t`: You can filter stored credentials by their type (e.g., SSH, RDP) using this command.

19. `db_nmap`: This command allows you to run Nmap scans and import the results into the Metasploit database.

20. `db_autopwn`: This command is used to automate the exploitation of vulnerable targets in the database.

Please keep in mind that the availability and behavior of these commands may change with updates to Metasploit, so it's important to refer to the official documentation or the `help` command within msfconsole for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
