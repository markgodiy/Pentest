Penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, typically consists of a series of phases to systematically assess the security of a system or network. These phases help ensure a thorough evaluation of potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses. The seven common phases of penetration testing are as follows:

#### Pre-engagement {#pre-engagement}
In this initial phase, the penetration tester and the client (the organization requesting the test) establish the scope, objectives, and rules of engagement for the test. This includes defining what systems or networks are within the scope, the testing methods to be used, and any legal or compliance requirements that must be followed.

#### Information Gathering (Reconnaissance) {#information-gathering-reconnaissance}
During this phase, the tester collects as much information as possible about the target environment. This includes publicly available information (such as DNS records, WHOIS data, and social media profiles), network scanning to identify live hosts, and gathering details about the target's infrastructure, systems, and services.

#### Enumeration and Vulnerability Analysis {#enumeration-and-vulnerability-analysis}
In this phase, the tester actively probes the target systems and services to identify vulnerabilities. Techniques like port scanning, banner grabbing, and service enumeration are used to discover potential weaknesses. Once identified, vulnerabilities are analyzed to determine their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.

#### Exploitation {#exploitation}
This phase involves attempting to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks. The goal is to simulate what an attacker with malicious intent might do. Exploitation can include password cracking, code execution, privilege escalation, and other attack techniques.

#### Post-exploitation {#post-exploitation}
After successfully compromising a system, the tester may perform activities to maintain access, pivot to other systems, and gather additional information. The post-exploitation phase simulates the actions of an attacker who has gained a foothold in the target environment.

#### Reporting {#reporting}
Following the testing activities, the penetration tester prepares a comprehensive report that documents the findings, including identified vulnerabilities, their severity, potential impact, and recommended remediation steps. This report is typically shared with the client to help them improve their security posture.

#### Cleanup and Remediation {#cleanup-and-remediation}
In this final phase, the tester ensures that any changes or activities conducted during the testing are rolled back or cleaned up. Additionally, the client is expected to prioritize and address the identified vulnerabilities and weaknesses as part of their security improvement efforts.

It's important to note that penetration testing should always be conducted in a controlled and ethical manner, with the explicit consent of the client organization. The goal is to help organizations identify and address security issues before malicious attackers can exploit them, thereby improving overall security posture.
