**Project 1: System Scan Report**
**Date: [Current Date]**

**Introduction:**
In this report, we present the findings of our network scan conducted for our esteemed client, Hotel Dorsey. The scope of this scan involved assessing the vulnerabilities and potential security risks present within the company's Linux system, which is hosting network services and database applications. It's important to emphasize that no exploitation of the remote systems was performed, as per the agreed scope of work. Our goal was to provide Hotel Dorsey with insights into critical vulnerabilities, application versions, and banner messages, enhancing their cybersecurity awareness and preparedness.

**Scope and Tools:**
Our penetration testing team utilized Kali, a specialized Linux distribution tailored for penetration testing purposes. The tools we employed included Zenmap, a graphical user interface for the Nmap network scanning utility, and OpenVAS, an open-source vulnerability assessment scanner. These tools allowed us to comprehensively assess the security posture of the client's Linux system.

**Target System:**
- IP Address: [Target IP Address]
- Hostname: [Target Hostname]
- Attack Machine IP: [Attack Machine IP]
- Attack Machine OS: Kali Linux

Below is a table summarizing the open ports and corresponding services discovered on the target system:

| Port | Service   | Description                       |
|------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| 22   | SSH       | Secure Shell                      |
| 80   | HTTP      | Web Server                        |
| 443  | HTTPS     | Secure Web Server                 |
| ...  | ...       | ...                               |

**Zenmap Scan:**
Our Zenmap scan revealed valuable insights into the vulnerabilities and services present on the target system. Please refer to the Zenmap scan report for detailed information on the scan results, including a labeled screenshot of the scan and a discussion on the potential impact of identified vulnerabilities.

**Open Socket:**
In addition to automated tools, we recognize the importance of manual assessments. Upon reviewing the reports, we noticed a port with limited banner information. By manually connecting to the corresponding socket, we were able to uncover potential vulnerabilities that automated tools might have missed. Refer to the labeled screenshot in the respective report for further details on this discovery.

**Recommendations:**
Based on our findings, we recommend that Hotel Dorsey considers expanding the scope of work to include a full penetration test. While our current assessment was limited to scanning and identification of vulnerabilities, we are confident that a deeper analysis involving exploitation testing could reveal more significant risks and help fortify the company's security infrastructure. This will empower Hotel Dorsey to proactively address potential vulnerabilities and enhance their overall cybersecurity posture.
