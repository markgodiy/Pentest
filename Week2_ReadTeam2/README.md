Hello, Read Team 2,

Read Team 2, Student 2, checking in. 

More info about me: "Penetration Testing and Cyber Red Teaming" is the last UMGC Cybersecurity course I need to satisfy the requirements for my degree. On the way here, I've taken the following: 

Fundamental of Computer Troubleshooting
Fundamentals of Networking
Network Security
Ethical Hacking
Cloud Technologies
Interconnecting Cisco Devices
Windows Server: Install & Stg
Linux System Administration
Current Trends and Projects in Computer Networks and Cybersecurity

Out of all of these, I enjoyed "Current Trends and Projects in Computer Networks and Cybersecurity" the most. In the class, we explored interesting technologies, thoughtfully discussed our experiences, and speculated as to how current and emerging technologies may converge and evolve to provide solutions for problems we're facing today as well as problems we may face in the future. 

As for this week's objectives, I successfully set up my attack and victim virtual machines, edited the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to assign static IP address, and was able to ping both virtual machines. Screenshots below:
