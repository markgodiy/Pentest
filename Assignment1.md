# Assignment 1

Each student in the class is assigned a different IP address for attack and victim machines.

Student IP Address:  `10.redteam[team number#].student[student number#].50`

![Alt text](image.png)

Tiffany Gibbon 10.2.1.50
Mark Go 10.2.2.50
Michael Hafke 10.2.3.50
Elmehdi Othmane 10.2.4.50
Christopher Rosa 10.2.5.50

## Configure the IP Settings

Once you get the virtualization software installed, use the following IP settings for the CMIT 386 virtual machines. 

Kali Linux (Attack Machine)

`leafpad /etc/network/interfaces`

```
IP Address: 10.2.2.50
Subnet Mask:  255.255.255.0
Gateway:  N/A
```

Metasploitable (Victim Machine)  

`gedit /etc/network/interfaces`

```
IP Address: 10.2.2.50
Subnet Mask:  255.255.255.0
Gateway: N/A
```

Each team member will be submitting a System Scan Report to the assignments folder at the end of Week 3.  

To get started, download the System Scan Report Template and follow the instructions in the document. Your scan report should include the following sections:

# Scenario: 

You and your team members are penetration testers at Haverbrook Security Lab. Your current client is Hotel Dorsey. 

You will use Kali, a Linux distribution for penetration testing, to scan the company’s Linux system, which is running network services and database applications. A penetration tester must know how to scan a target machine to discover what vulnerabilities might be present on the remote system.  

It is critical to understand that during this phase of the project, no exploitation of the remote systems is permitted. The scope of work allows for scanning but not any type of exploitation at this time. Serious consequences, like criminal charges, could result in a real-world engagement if the contractor goes beyond the agreed scope of work. 

Hotel Dorsey has given you permission to scan its system using Nmap, Zenmap, OpenVAS, as well as any of the tools available on the Kali distribution that your contractor provided. The client is looking for information about critical vulnerabilities, banner messages, and application versions. If you feel that the client’s systems are not vulnerable or not at risk, it is your duty to report that as well. If you find critical issues within the client’s system, you need to convey these issues well so the client will consider expanding the scope of work and amend the contract. Even if there are many security issues, management will not take them seriously if your report does not specify those issues and their urgency. 

At this point, you should realize that having the best keyboard penetration skills in the business will not help you if you are not able to properly document your findings and convey the critical issues to the client. This is your task in Project 1, the System Scan Report. 


## Introduction

In this section, create an overview and discuss the scope of your network scan. Note the operating system of your attack machine and describe the tools that you will use (Zenmap, OpenVAS). Remember that this report will be reviewed by nontechnical people who may not know about Zenmap or OpenVAS.

## Target

In this section, list the IP address and hostname of the target system as well as the IP address assigned to your attack machine. Focus on the open ports and describe the corresponding services associated with the open ports. Maintain the tone you set in the introduction, keeping in mind that the report will be reviewed by some who will not know about FTP or SSH or what functions those services provide on a network. Place the information about the ports and corresponding services into a table and label it appropriately.  

## Zenmap Scan

In this section, use Zenmap to scan the victim machine as well as a screenshot of the connection to the victim system. Show a labeled screenshot of the Zenmap scan. Explain the results and how the vulnerabilities might impact the client.  

## OpenVAS Scan

In this section, use OpenVAS to scan the victim machine as well as a screenshot of the connection to the victim system. Show a labeled screenshot of the OpenVAS scan. Explain the results and how the vulnerabilities might impact the client.  

## Open Socket

Now that you have scanned the system with Zenmap and OpenVAS, go back to either of the reports and look for a port that provided little information about the banner or provided you with an unknown. By manually connecting to the IP and port (socket), you can sometimes discover a vulnerability not listed by the tool. This shows you the importance of not just relying on a tool. Show a labeled screenshot of a connection to a socket providing results using a browser or netcat, etc. If you find something concerning, explain that to the client.  

## Recommendations

In this section, you will suggest that the client amend the contract to add a full penetration test. Explain that you are confident that you will be able to exploit the system and take proprietary data from the network.  

## References

In this section, validate your recommendations using industry standard techniques by including at least two to three references in IEEE format.
