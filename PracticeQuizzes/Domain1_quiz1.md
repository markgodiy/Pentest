   a) To define the rules of engagement
   b) To identify vulnerabilities
   c) To establish communication protocols
   d) To outline the scope of testing

2. In a penetration test, what is the key difference between passive and active reconnaissance?

   a) Passive reconnaissance gathers information without alerting the target.
   b) Active reconnaissance uses social engineering.
   c) Passive reconnaissance is faster.
   d) Active reconnaissance requires the use of specialized tools.

3. Why is it important to establish an Authorization to Test (ATT) before conducting a penetration test?

   a) To define the rules of engagement
   b) To schedule the testing
   c) To determine the cost of the engagement
   d) To obtain legal permission to test

4. Which of the following should be a part of the Rules of Engagement (RoE) for a penetration test?

   a) Details of the tester's compensation
   b) List of known vulnerabilities
   c) Scope of testing
   d) List of authorized users

5. What is the primary goal of compliance-based assessments during a penetration test?

   a) To identify vulnerabilities
   b) To ensure legal compliance
   c) To measure the effectiveness of security controls
   d) To identify weaknesses in security policies

6. Why is documentation crucial in the penetration testing process?

   a) To generate revenue for the organization
   b) To comply with industry regulations
   c) To provide evidence of the engagement and its findings
   d) To impress clients with a professional report

7. In which phase of penetration testing is open-source intelligence (OSINT) typically used?

   a) Exploitation
   b) Post-Exploitation
   c) Planning and Scoping
   d) Vulnerability Identification

8. Which of the following is an example of active reconnaissance?

   a) Scanning open ports
   b) Monitoring network traffic passively
   c) Reading publicly available documents
   d) Conducting social engineering attacks

9. What role does the Service-Level Agreement (SLA) play in a penetration testing engagement?

   a) It outlines the scope of testing.
   b) It defines the rules of engagement.
   c) It determines the cost of the engagement.
   d) It lists all discovered vulnerabilities.

10. Which legal concept provides protection to individuals and organizations that report security vulnerabilities responsibly?

    a) Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
    b) Fair Use doctrine
    c) Safe Harbor
    d) Compliance framework

11. During the scoping phase, why is it important to define the boundaries of the penetration test?

    a) To ensure that no vulnerabilities are overlooked
    b) To identify the test environment
    c) To determine the duration of the engagement
    d) To clarify what is in and out of scope

12. What is the primary goal of passive reconnaissance during a penetration test?

    a) To gather information without alerting the target
    b) To identify and exploit vulnerabilities
    c) To establish command and control
    d) To launch DDoS attacks

13. What is the main purpose of an Authorization to Test (ATT) in penetration testing?

    a) To determine the cost of the engagement
    b) To identify vulnerabilities
    c) To obtain legal permission to test
    d) To define the scope of testing

14. Which of the following is a key consideration when conducting vulnerability assessments?

    a) Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities
    b) Measuring the effectiveness of security controls
    c) Identifying and recommending appropriate mitigation strategies
    d) Establishing a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)

15. What is the primary focus of penetration testing as compared to vulnerability assessment?

    a) Identifying vulnerabilities
    b) Gathering information about the target
    c) Exploiting vulnerabilities
    d) Measuring the effectiveness of security controls

16. In a penetration test, what does the Rules of Engagement (RoE) document typically specify?

    a) The compensation for the penetration tester
    b) The scope of testing and rules for engagement
    c) A list of discovered vulnerabilities
    d) The target organization's financial data

17. What is the primary purpose of reconnaissance in a penetration testing engagement?

    a) To exploit vulnerabilities
    b) To gather information about the target
    c) To establish command and control
    d) To generate a detailed report

18. In a penetration test, what is the main goal of the scoping phase?

    a) To identify vulnerabilities
    b) To determine the cost of the engagement
    c) To clarify the rules of engagement
    d) To define the boundaries and objectives of testing

19. Which of the following is an example of passive reconnaissance?

    a) Scanning for open ports on a target system
    b) Sending phishing emails to employees
    c) Reading publicly available documents
    d) Exploiting a known vulnerability

20. Why is it essential to establish an Authorization to Test (ATT) before conducting a penetration test?

    a) To identify vulnerabilities
    b) To ensure legal permission to test
    c) To define the rules of engagement
    d) To schedule the engagement and allocate resources

These questions are designed to test your knowledge of planning and scoping in penetration testing and may help you prepare for the CompTIA Pentest+ PT0-002 exam.
