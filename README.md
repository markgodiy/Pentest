    - Developed by Pete Herzog
    - Distributed by Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISecOM) https://www.isecom.org/
    - OSSTMM version 3 PDF https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf

- Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)

#### 2. Rules of Engagement

- Time of Day
- Types of allowed/disallowed tests
- Other restrictions

#### 3. Environmental Considerations

- Network Infrastructure Testing

    - Evaluate security posture of physical network, e.g., switches, routers, firewalls, and supporting structures such as Authentication-Authorization-Account (AAA) servers and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

    - Wireless infrastructure may be included in the scope, to assess vulnerability of security mechanisms or cryptographic methods. Signal disbursement "heatmap" typically used. 

- Application-Based Testing

    - A great resource is Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

    - Focuses on security weaknesses in Enterprise applications, e.g.:
        - Misconfigurations
        - Input Validation Errors
        - Injection vulnerabity
        - Logic flaws  

    - Scope typically includes back-end database, by assessing if access to the database can be obtained by exploiting weakness in the [web] application. 

- Cloud Penetration Test
    
    - Understand the scope to know what is permitted or unauthorized when performing the PenTest.

    - Consider that data still exists in a physical location despite being in the "Cloud". The Customer and the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) must have a clear understanding, in writing, of who is responsible for various components of the Cloud infrastructure. 
    
    - AWS created the Shared Responsibility Model (SRM) to explain how overall security is defined and shared between customers and AWS as a CSP, e.g., for AWS Infrastructure-as-a-Service (Iaas), customers are responsible for data, applications, runtime, middleware, VM's, containers and Operating Systems in VMs. 

    - CSP commonly provide policies for Penetration Testing against their infrastructure.
        - AWS https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/
        - Azure https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement
        - GCP https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6262505?hl=en
        
#### 4. Target List; In-Scope Assets

- Wireless Networks
- Internet Protocol Ranges
- Domains
- Application Programming Interfaces (API)
- Physical Locations
- Domain Name System (DNS)
- External vs Internal Targets
- First-party or third-party hosted

#### 5. Validate Scope of Engagement

- Question the client/review contracts
- Time management
- Strategy: Unknown vs Known Environment

    - "Black Box" Unknown-Environment
        - Tester is provided with very limited amount of info to simulate the perspective of an external hacker, e.g., only given domain name and some IP Addresses
        - Additional information will need to be collected prior to PenTest
        - Internal IT may not be notified when PenTest is taking place to simulate real-world defensive response

    - "White Box" Known-Environment
        - Designed with a much broader scope to fully assess and audit security
        - Tester is provided with a lot of information about organization and infrastructure
        - Budget (Time/Money) can be a deciding factor on the scope and what's possible

    - "Grey Box" Partially known
        - Hybrid environment where testers may be given access credentials but no other details about the network. 
        - Designed to simulate a breach where an attacker has access to a client within the network so they could pivot throughout the network to determine impact of potential compromise. 



### 3. Given a Scenario, demonstrate an ethical hacking mindset by maintaining profressionalism and integrity
- Background checks of penetration testing team
- Adhere to specific scope of engagement
- Identify criminal activity
- Immediately report breaches/criminal activity
- Limit use of tools to a particular engagement
- Limit invasiveness based on scope
- Maintain confidentiality of data/information
- Risks to the professional
    - Fees/fines
    - Criminal Charges


## 2. (22%) Information Gather/Vulnerability Scanning 

### 1. Given a scenario, perform passive reconnaissance

#### 1. DNS Lookups

#### 2. Identify technical contacts

#### 3. Administrator contacts

#### 4. Cloud vs. Self-Hosted
- Social edia scraping
    - Key contacts/Job responsibilities
    - Job listing/Technology stack
- Crytographic flaws
    - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates
    - Revocation
- Company reputation/Security posture
    - Password dumps
    - File metadata
    - Strategic search engine
