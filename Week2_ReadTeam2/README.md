Welcome to your red team!

This week, each team member will be setting up a hacking lab in preparation for doing the system scan for Project 1.

First, take some time to introduce yourself.

What career/cyber-related courses have you taken?
What subject areas did you find most interesting in those courses?
Confirm your team and student number (example: redteam 1, student 3)

If you haven't done so already, review the Virtual Machine Hacking Lab Setup Instructions, download the two virtual machines, and follow the instructions to set up your hacking lab. Take a screenshot of the successful ping between your Kali and Metasploitable machine, keeping in mind that each student in the class has a unique set of IP addresses. Let your red team members know that your systems are running and thank them for their help.

Remember to be respectful, provide others with positive encouragement and congratulate your teammates after they have been connected and have configured everything.

A true red "team" will leave no one behind and will make sure that all members are successful.

"Penetration Testing and Cyber Red Teaming" is the last UMGC Cybersecurity course I need to satisfy the requirements for my degree. On the way here, I've taken the following: 

Fundamental of Computer Troubleshooting
Fundamentals of Networking
Network Security
Ethical Hacking
Cloud Technologies
Interconnecting Cisco Devices
Windows Server: Install & Stg
Linux System Administration
Current Trends and Projects in Computer Networks and Cybersecurity

Out of all of these, I enjoyed "Current Trends and Projects in Computer Networks and Cybersecurity" the most. In the class, we explored interesting technologies, thoughtfully discussed, and speculated as to how current and emerging technologies may converge and evolve to provide solutions for problems we're facing today as well as problems we may face in the future.
