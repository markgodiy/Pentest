## Setting up msf db

Using a database with the Metasploit Framework's `msfconsole` enhances performance, session management, and data persistence in penetration testing. It allows efficient tracking of sessions, maintains historical records of module execution, supports collaborative work, and enables resource management, making it a valuable tool for ethical hackers and security professionals.

```bash
# start postgresql service
service postgresql start

# initialize msf dabatase
msfdb init

# start msfconsole
msfconsole

# connect database
db_connect -y /usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml
```

## db_nmap

once we have our db connection established, we can run the db version of nmap. This allows us to automatically store the results of nmap into the ms framework.
