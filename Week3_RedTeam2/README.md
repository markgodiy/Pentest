Hello, Read Team 2, 

As described from the Greenbone OpenVAS website, OpenVAS is an full-featured open-source tool for identifying security vulnerabilities in systems and networks (Greenbone OpenVAS 2023). It's essential for Red Teamers as it helps pinpoint weaknesses, assess risks, and plan effective attacks. By scanning and evaluating vulnerabilities, OpenVAS aids in scoping targets, setting baselines, and producing detailed reports for documentation and correspondence with clients. Its customizable scans and integration capabilities make it a powerful asset for comprehensive security assessments. 

For this week's objective, I successfully performed an OpenVAS scan of target IP 10.2.2.100

First, I initiated an OpenVAS instance using terminal command `openvas-start` which started a browser-based interface for OpenVAS. 

From the web interface top menu bar, I clicked on Scans > Tasks. Then I created a new Task, added a Scan Target, and clicked the Launch button to begin the scan. 

The scan took several minutes to complete but eventually I was to check under Scans > Reports, click on the Date of the scan Report, and view the details:

It's awesome for a free product. Takes a little getting-used-to, but I like it.
